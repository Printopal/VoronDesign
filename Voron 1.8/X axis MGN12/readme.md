# X axis MGN12 + Gates idlers + Hartk PCB + ADXL mount
# OVERVIEW
This mod allow to replace the originals 2x MGN9 rails by a single MGN12 on X axis.
In the mean time I modififed the XY joints to match the Gates idler height (10mm) and add a clearance on the right XY joint so there is no conflict with the toolhead PCB (Hartk).
Finally, there is a dedicated channel for X endstop wires, the possiblity to use the PL-xx Probe and an ADXL mount.
